# BankingSystemProject
Banking System Mini-Project for Springboard Data Engineering Bootcamp

Within this banking system project, we basically want to ensure we have classes for Customer, Accounts, Employee and Services. Based on these types of classes to simulate a banking system, we want to think about how to create subclasses. For example, the Accounts class will have a CheckingAccount and SavingsAccount subclass. In addition, we can simply create a Person class, where Customer and Employee inherit from the Person class. Employees can have different benefits, etc. Services can be loans, etc.

We want to make sure that we are working on making this banking system as simple, yet effectively using the important OOP concepts.

As of right now, I simply need to make changes to the CheckingAccount and SavingsAccount methods, and figure out what methods to attach to each class.
